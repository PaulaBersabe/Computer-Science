# Computer-Science
 The following assignment adresses the problem of duplicate detection of products in
 large-scale e-commerce by using Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH). It integrates key-value pairs
 (e.g., brand, screen size, resolution) and model words extracted from product titles, convert
ing them into binary vectors for LSH-based candidate generation. Similarity between candidate
 pairs is computed by a Multi Component Similarity metric that combines Cosine, Jaccard,
 Q-gram similarities, key-value matching, and Hierarchical Structure Matching. In addition, hi
erarchical clustering is used to group related duplicates. The performance of the methodology is
 assessed using key metrics, including Pair Completeness, Pair Quality, F1-measure, and a robust
 bootstrapping evaluation to ensure reliability.
